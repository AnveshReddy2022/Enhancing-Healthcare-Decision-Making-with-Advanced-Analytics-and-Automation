# Project Spotlight: Transforming Healthcare Data into Actionable Insights ðŸš€

Project 1: Healthcare Analytics Dashboard
I recently developed a comprehensive dashboard using healthcare finance data that provides a detailed view of key performance indicators (KPIs) and statistics. This dashboard, as shown below, consolidates critical billing information, offering a clear and actionable perspective on costs across procedures, departments, and patient demographics.

Project 2: Automated Invoice Generation
Building on the same dataset, I designed an automated invoice system. This tool dynamically generates invoices based on existing data, with options to download and send them with just a click. The automation significantly reduces manual effort, ensuring accuracy and efficiency in the billing process.

Both projects reflect my commitment to leveraging data to drive meaningful outcomes in the healthcare sector.
